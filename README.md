# Drastic.DownloadButton

Drastic.DownloadButton is a binding of [DownloadButton](https://github.com/PavelKatunin/DownloadButton) for .NET iOS, Catalyst, macOS, and tvOS.

This includes a fork of the original code, as I needed to turn it into a framework to make it easier to consume.

# How To

- Run the included sample and see the implementation of `PKViewController`
